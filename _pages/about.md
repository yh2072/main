# Yuqi Hang

## Current Position
Ph.D. Student in Educational Communication and Technology  
New York University  
Expected Graduation: May 2027

## Research Focus
My research interests span the intersection of educational neuroscience, virtual reality, multimodal affective computing, and artificial intelligence in education. I specialize in evidence-based learning experience design in virtual environments, with a particular emphasis on neuroaesthetics and emotional design.

## Research Projects

### Current Research
- **Emotional Design in Immersive Virtual Learning Environments**  
  Leading research on measuring emotional induction in VR environments using biometric data collection systems. Implementing Neurokit2 for data quality assessment and event-related HRV analysis. Designing stimulus animations and conducting particle effect studies in VR to validate emotional induction effectiveness.

- **VR-based Neurofeedback in Natural Space Group Psychotherapy**  
  Developing 3D models of natural spaces using Sketchup for CAVE projection. Implementing auditory neurofeedback through EEG signal-controlled music volume modulation using Python (pygame, websocket, json). Integrating PERMA theory with nature therapy and utilizing AI emotional voice synthesis for meditation videos.

### Past Research
- **Computational Cognitive Modeling of Human Emotions**  
  Conducted fine-grained emotion classification using RoBERTa, investigating the relationship between internal emotional representations and human emotional processing. Developed multi-label classification models with MLP, self-attention mechanisms, and multi-layer classification heads.

- **EEG-based Player Immersion Classification**  
  Implemented CNN-BiLSTM models and Deep Belief Networks for classifying player immersion levels using consumer-grade EEG data. Achieved 79% accuracy in detecting high/low immersion states through 7-fold cross-validation.
