Predictions are constantly generated from diverse sources to optimize cognitive functions in the ever-changing environment. However, the neural origin and generation process of top-down induced prediction remain elusive. We hypothesized that motor-based and memory-based predictions are mediated by distinct descending networks from motor and memory systems to the sensory cortices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a dual imagery paradigm, we found that motor and memory upstream systems activated the auditory cortex in a content-specific manner. Moreover, the inferior and posterior parts of the parietal lobe differentially relayed predictive signals in motor-to-sensory and memory-to-sensory networks. Dynamic causal modeling of directed connectivity revealed selective enabling and modulation of connections that mediate top-down sensory prediction and ground the predictive processes in the brain.
